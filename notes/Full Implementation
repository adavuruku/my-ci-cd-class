#Branching strategy

1. github flow

2. git flow [not adviced]

main
    -> future branch (fb) [introduce changes] -> pr (from fb to main) [ CI (workflows [run test, build, lint, security scanning ...])] -> if all successful -> deploy to stagging


deploy to stagging
vpc -> ecs [do functional tests etc]

option:
1. you can decise to have a deployment for every pr such that every pr rasie its own ec2 instances for testing [ staging] [not cost effective]



### after mergin the pr to main branch -> 
1. deploy to production automatically

3. manual trigger the deploy to production

blue/green deployment
you can manual deploy to the staging ec2 to make sure everything is fully deployed and working fine
before switching the older ec2 serving ur clients to the staging one
